Bindle Binaries Objective-C Kit
===============================

   The Bindle Binaries Objective-C Kit is a collection of Objective-C
   classes that were created to fulfill a need in a particular project but
   may be of use in additional iOS or OS X projects.  For example the
   BKMemoryCache class is generic enough to be used in projects other than
   the one for which it was originally written.
